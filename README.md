You must have NodeJS installed on your computer to install the dependencies and required packages.\

### `cd client`

Changes terminal location to the clientside app\
The IDE will then bring you to the projects proper starting location for below commands.\

### `npm install`

This will install the dependencies and required packages for this web application.\
This step is required and cannot be skipped or the below commands will fail.\

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Current bug

I didn't have time to implement multiple components so I used one which messes with my states and I didn't have time to finish it so you will need to hit the start button a few times. (4)
